- Using a combination of VS-code, GitHub Desktop and git-bash. I like VS and git-bash :/
- Branch naming conventions
	- `feature/${featureName}`
- Merge to test before merging to master.
	- Auto runs tests
- Remember to rebase active branch before attempting to continue development.
	- This may need to be done a couple times in order to ensure up to date changes
- Preferred method is to create a conflict branch and merge that way.
	- Naming convention: `feature/${featureName}-conflict`
